An app which is build with React Native and will be used for test (automation) purposes.

## About
As mentioned above I want to use this app to explore the possibilities for testing a (React) Native app (iOS / Android).
In order to understand what I need to test I told myself that I needed to be able to build a React Native app, so here it is :-) 
This app has three tabs that all do something different. More info will follow in the coming months. You can also follow my progress on my [site / blog](http://www.wswebcreation.nl/)

### Home
This is the intro of the app

### Webview
In the Webview you can enter an URL and load it in the Webview

### Chats
In the chats I created multiple API calls to retrieve JSON data from [GitHubGist](https://gist.github.com/wswebcreation). 
When you select a chat you will get a chatbox. Here you can add chats and you will get a response (some movie onliners) from my gist.

## Install
This will only work on a MAC so get started execute the following steps:

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/wswebcreation/wswebcreation-react-native-app.git`
2. Go to the folder: `cd wswebcreation-react-native-app`
3. Install all (dev)dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the project for iOS `npm run ios`, for Android run `npm run android`
5. Happy playing!

## Different environment builds
This project already supports different environment builds. This means that

- specific configurations can be save into different environment files, see in the root of the project the `.env` and `.env.{environment}`-files
- different builds can be created with running for example the command `npm start ios.automation` or `npm start android.automation`

They advantage of this will be that config variables can be exposed to the JS code in React Native in an easy way.

> Currently only the `BASE_URL` and the `ENVIRONMENT` variables are saved and used from the `.env`-files, but in the future this can be more.  

## Disable Animations
Because of the different environments we can also pinpoint which type of build we have. For for example the automation build we want to limit the amount of animations.
Animations can be a killer for waits and can increase the execution time of tests. With some small changes in the code there is a possibility to create a specific automation build without animations.

In most cases all libraries use the `Animated`-component of React Native to animate stuff. [`timing`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html#timing) or [`spring`](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/animated.html#spring) are used to add the durations and so on.
These methods can easily be stubbed which you will find below

### Implementation
See the [`index.js`](./index.js) file in the root of the project. There you will see two extra lines of code

```js
import { setupAutomation } from './app/config/TestProperties';

setupAutomation();
```

They need to be added and executed at the highest level of the app, to be able to stub all the animations, and refer to the [`TestProperties.js`](./app/config/TestProperties.js). 
Together with a stub library called `stubs` we can stub almost all animations that come from the `Animation`-component from React Native. 

This will give a build like below. On the left iPhone you see the normal build, on the right the automation build with no animation when the chat is loaded on the card

> *In my testapp I use [react-navigation](https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation). You can do all nice things with animations and custom animations. In my app I've chosen to use the default animation which was "harder" to stub, but with a dirty little hack you understand and see the difference ;-).*

## Testing

### Appium
>**Make sure you've installed Appium on your local machine. There are a lot of good articles on the web the help you with that. You can start with the [Appium Docs](http://appium.io/docs/en/about-appium/getting-started/)**

>**Don't forget to set all the environment variables for Android, see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19986214/setting-android-home-enviromental-variable-on-mac-os-x) or Google it ;-)**

#### Android and ChromeDriver
When accessing a webview on Android it could be that you get this error

    An unknown server-side error occurred while processing the command.
    Original error: unknown error: Chrome version must be >= 55.0.2883.0

You can fix this by checking the [docs](https://appium.io/docs/en/writing-running-appium/web/chromedriver/) on Appium by downgrading ChromeDriver during install. The right version can be found [here](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.35/notes.txt). 
 
> **Change the number of ChromeDriver tot the latest version to see an overview of all versions**
