## About
As mentioned above I want to use this app to explore the possibilities for testing a (React) Native app (iOS / Android).
In order to understand what I need to test I told myself that I needed to be able to build a React Native app, so here it is :-) This app has three tabs that all do something different. More info will follow in the coming months. You can also follow my progress on my [site / blog](http://www.wswebcreation.nl/)

### Home
This is the intro of the app

### Webview
In the Webview you can enter an URL and load it in the Webview

### Chats
In the chats I created multiple API calls to retrieve JSON data from [GitHubGist](https://gist.github.com/wswebcreation). When you select a chat you will get a chatbox. Here you can add chats and you will get a response (some movie onliners) from my gist.

## Install
This will only work on a MAC so get started execute the following steps:

1. Clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/wswebcreation/wswebcreation-react-native-app.git`
2. Go to the folder: `cd wswebcreation-react-native-app`
3. Install all (dev)dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the project: `react-native run-ios`
5. Happy playing!
